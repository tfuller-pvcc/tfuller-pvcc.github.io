		<td>Term</td>
		<td>Definition</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Operating Sytem</td>
		<td>The software that supports a computer's basic functions, such as scheduling tasks, executing applications, and controlling peripherals.
        </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Job queue</td>
		<td>A list of tasks to be carried out in turn by an operating system.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>FIFO</td>
		<td>A valuation method in which the assets produced or acquired first are sold, used, or disposed of first.
        </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Interactive Processing</td>
		<td>The process of interacting directly with a program and/or data for immediately modifying, retrieving and/or displaying information. This is usually done on a computer screen.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Time-sharing</td>
		<td>The operation of a computer system by several users for different operations at the same time.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Multiprogramming</td>
		<td>The running of two or more programs or sequences of instructions simultaneously by a computer with more than one central processor.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td>Application Software</td>
		<td>An application, also referred to as an application program or application software, is a computer software package that performs a specific function directly for an end user or, in some cases, for another application. An application can be self-contained or a group of programs.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td>System Software</td>
		<td>System software is a type of computer program that is designed to run a computer's hardware and application programs. If we think of the computer system as a layered model, the system software is the interface between the hardware and user applications.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td>Utility Software</td>
		<td>In computers, a utility is a small program that provides an addition to the capabilities provided by the operating system. In some usages, a utility is a special and nonessential part of the operating system. The print "utility" that comes with the operating system is an example.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</td>
		<td>A graphics-based operating system interface that uses icons, menus and a mouse (to click on the icon or pull down the menus) to manage interaction with the system.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Shell</td>
		<td>The shell is the layer of programming that understands and executes the commands a user enters. In some systems, the shell is called a command interpreter. A shell usually implies an interface with a command syntax (think of the DOS operating system and its "C:>" prompts and user commands such as "dir" and "edit").</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td>Kernel</td>
		<td>The kernel is a core component of an operating system and serves as the main interface between the computer's physical hardware and the processes running on it. The kernel enables multiple applications to share hardware resources by providing access to CPU, memory, disk I/O, and networking</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td>Device Driver</td>
		<td>A device driver is a special kind of software program that controls a specific hardware device attached to a computer. Device drivers are essential for a computer to work properly.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td>File Manager</td>
		<td>The File Manager is a system software responsible for the creation, deletion, modification of the files and managing their access, security and the resources used by them. These functions are performed in collaboration with the Device Manager.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td>Memory Manager</td>
		<td>Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating a computer's main memory. It ensures that blocks of memory space are properly managed and allocated so the operating system (OS), applications and other running processes have the memory they need to carry out their operations.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td>Virtual Memory</td>
		<td>A virtual manager is a tool or resource that allows for the management of more than one computer from a single workstation.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td>Bootstrapping</td>
		<td>What is bootstrap in a computer? In computing, the term bootstrap means to boot or to load a program into a computer using a much smaller initial program to load in the desired program, which is usually an OS.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td>ROM</td>
		<td>ROM (read-only memory) is a non-volatile memory type. This means it receives data and permanently writes it on a chip, and it lasts even after you turn off your computer. The data is coded to not be overwritten, so it's used for things like your printer software or your startup programs.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td>Deadlock</td>
		<td>A deadlock is a situation in which two computer programs sharing the same resource are effectively preventing each other from accessing the resource, resulting in both programs ceasing to function.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td>Spooling</td>
		<td>In computing, spooling is a specialized form of multi-programming for the purpose of copying data between different devices. In contemporary systems, it is usually used for mediating between a computer application and a slow peripheral, such as a printer.</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td>Super User (or admin)</td>
		<td>A person with unlimited access privileges who can perform any and all operations within the computer</td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
		<td>Multifactor Authentication</td>
		<td>Multi-factor authentication is a layered approach to securing data and applications where a system requires a user to present a combination of two or more credentials to verify a user's identity for login.</td>
	</tr>
